dependencies (likely, incomplete):

pax/12-gcc-plugin-infra.patch:
- misc/02-shared-object-support.patch
- misc/13-fix-hostcflags-aflags.patch
pax/15-rap.patch:
- misc/20-properly-gate-features.patch
pax/uderef-kernexec:
- pax/78-access-ok-without-pre-faulting.patch

procedure:

- i'm definitely going for the lower-hanging fruit first, and then get to harder parts as i begin to understand them more properly;

placement:

- i put __read_only additions/__refdata removal stuff as part of pax/constify, but i'm not sure if that's entirely correct;
- i put all the < 0 checks as part of pax/size_overflow, but i'm not entirely sure that's the right place either;
- i put the info.low_limit/info.high_limit changes as part of grsec/rand_threadstack, but i'm not sure if that's the right place;
- i merged uderef and kernexec for the initial splitting phase as they seem heavily intertwined - proper splitting will follow after the initial split;

further splits:

- the check_heap_stack_gap() stuff that's in grsec/rand_threadstack right now probably needs splitting up so that the call gets added separately;
- pax/aslr.patch needs more splitting
