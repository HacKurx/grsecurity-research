dependencies (likely, incomplete):

pax/12-gcc-plugins.patch:
- misc/02-shared-object-support.patch
- misc/13-fix-hostcflags-aflags.patch
pax/15-rap.patch:
- misc/20-properly-gate-features.patch

procedure:

- i'm definitely going for the lower-hanging fruit first, and then get to harder parts as i begin to understand them more properly;

placement:

- i put __read_only stuff as part of pax/constify, but i'm not sure if that's entirely correct;
- i put all the < 0 checks as part of pax/size_overflow, but i'm not entirely sure that's the right place either;
