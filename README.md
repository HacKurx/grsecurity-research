## Progress

Phase 1:

```
Â» ./scripts/progress.sh
split hunks: 744 (7.3%)
remaining hunks: 9449
total hunks: 10173
```

## Disclaimer

I stepped into this with only an end-user's knowledge of grsecurity/PaX, and thus may categorize or split stuff wrong. Be aware of this, and suggestions are of course welcome.
The point is mostly learning how grsecurity and PaX work internally, properly.

## Phases

1. **(current)** Split up `grsecurity-3.1-4.9.24-201704252333.patch` into semantically meaningful tinier patches, grouped by feature they are implementing;
2. From smaller patches, gain knowledge about how the features work exactly, together with docs at https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs, https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewforum.php?f=7 and https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewforum.php?f=1;
   * Maybe ask spender or pipacs about specific still-hard-to-understand stuff after reading the above if they're feeling charitable?
3. ???
4. Profit? Maybe at least a tinier degree more maintainability.

## Structure

* `grsecurity-3.1-4.9.24-201704252333.patch`: Unedited original last public testing patch;
* `scripts`: Scripts to help the splitting process;
* `split`: The split up patches;
  - `split/pax`: PaX features;
  - `split/grsec`: grsecurity features;
  - `split/misc`: Features that don't specifically belong to PaX or grsecurity like general cleanups;
  - `split/xx-grsecurity-3.1-4.9.24-201704252333.patch`: The unsplit remainder of the original patch;
* `notes.txt`: Random notes taken by me while splitting up, may contain useful stuff, most likely not.

## Scripts

* `scripts/progress.sh`: Show progress in terms of split-up hunks;
* `scripts/patch.sh`: Fetch Linux 4.9.24 and (re-)apply the current split-up patchset against it;
* `scripts/compare.sh`: Compare the split-up patched kernel against a kernel patched with the original patch, to detect mistakes made during the splitting process.
